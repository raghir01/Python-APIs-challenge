Analyzed the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.
Randomly selected 500+ unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude and
performed a weather check on each of the cities using weather API calls. Used python pandas
to perform data analytics on the collected JSON data via API. Produced inferences from the
analysis and produced graphs to visualize the findings.
Used Jupyter notebook for data exploration and used matplotlib to produce graphs.
